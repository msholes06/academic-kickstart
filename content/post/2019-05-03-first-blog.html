<p>For my first website using Hugo and markdown I decided to go with the Academic-Kick Start and utilizing Git Desktop to push my source code to Netlify. I ran into some errors along the way. First, I followed the recommended workflow step by step and was unable to install the academic-kick start theme. I was given Error: Unable to find theme Directory: C:_blog. So after doing some further research into the documentation I decided to just clone the academic-kick start git into my local git desktop. This worked fine, however more errors persisted once I tried to add a new post under addins. The issue:</p>
<p>blogdown:::new_post_addin() Error in blogdown:::site_root() : Could not find config.toml / config.yaml under C:/Users/Mike/Documents/Visual Analytics/HW_4/academic-kickstart C:/Users/Mike/Documents/Visual Analytics/HW_4 C:/Users/Mike/Documents/Visual Analytics C:/Users/Mike/Documents C:/Users/Mike C:/Users C:/</p>
<p>After doing some further research I found that the config.toml was not located under the root directory, however was broken up under a new file called content. It seems that others had the same issue:</p>
<p>Hi <span class="citation">@yihui</span>,</p>
<p>Someone else alerted me to a refactoring of Hugo exampleSites, as with the hugo-academic theme. I reproduced the issue with Hugo version 0.53 using gcushen/hugo-academic theme.</p>
<p>Here is the author’s commit that changed the structure.</p>
<p>And here is the new exampleSite: <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite" class="uri">https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite</a></p>
<p>The most significant change is that multiple .toml files now exist (languages, params, and menus are pulled out separately), instead of one config.toml file.</p>
<p>For reference, here was the old exampleSite config.toml file: <a href="https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/blob/master/themes/hugo-academic/exampleSite/config.toml" class="uri">https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/blob/master/themes/hugo-academic/exampleSite/config.toml</a></p>
<p>Here is the beginning of the OLD main menus:</p>
<p>Navigation Links To link a homepage widget, specify the URL as a hash <code>#</code> followed by the filename of the desired widget in your <code>content/home/</code> folder. The weight parameter defines the order that the links will appear in. [params.menus] # Align the main menu to the right of the page? (true/false) align_right = true</p>
<p>[[menu.main]] name = “Home” url = “#about” weight = 1</p>
<p>In the new exampleSite menu.toml this same section looks like this:</p>
<p>Navigation Links To link a homepage widget, specify the URL as a hash <code>#</code> followed by the filename of the desired widget in your <code>content/home/</code> folder. The weight parameter defines the order that the links will appear in.</p>
<p>[[main]] name = “Home” url = “#about” weight = 1</p>
<p>However, no naive quick fixes worked me (I tried created a master config.toml file by pasting the multiples into one and updating the names of the params, I also tried using the old example config file and just pasting that in). Not sure if you have seen this recently with any other themes, but it seemed like a pretty drastic restructuring so wanted to make sure you are aware of it.</p>
<p>To fix this I ended up moving the config.toml file to the root directory and bingo I was able to add a new post through the Blogdown addins button. All of this took a lot of time which I was running out of as I am writting the rest of the blog. Also, I spent a lot of time on the about me page making it fully functional with responsive icons and updating my information. I am not sure if the certificates from my data camp courses will load once clicked on due to being routed to the certificate url. I was thinking about adding the .pdf files of this into the static files and seeing if this would work. I also added a map using the map api from Openstreet Map in the contact section. Also, instead of using the serve_site() fuction to see my edits, I would make a push to github everytime so now I believe I have something over 100 commits. Based on the documentation on hugo it was suggested to not use serve_site() because the author stated that it was outdated and buggy, Oh Well. I told you this post would be trial and fire. Its time to serve_site() and do one final push through github and see what happens.</p>
